# Malware Analysis (Binary Classification) using Kernel Constrained Subspace Method KCSM

## Overview

This project focuses on malware analysis, specifically targeting malware spoofing and binary classification challenges. We implement the Kernel Constrained Subspace Method (KCSM) augmented with Random Fourier Features (RFF_CSM) for efficient and effective malware detection.

- Enhanced malware detection using KCSM, capable of distinguishing between malware and benign files.
- Improved computational efficiency with the integration of RFF, reducing the complexity of kernel calculations.
- Suitable for large-scale and real-time malware detection systems.

## Summary
This paper proposes a novel approach based on subspace representation for malware detection, an important task of distinguishing between safe and malware (malicious) file classes. Our solution is to utilize a target software's byte-level visualization (image pattern) and represent the two classes by low-dimensional subspaces respectively, in high-dimensional vector space. We use the kernel constrained subspace method (KCSM) as a classifier, which has shown excellent results in various pattern recognition tasks. However, its computational cost may be high due to the use of kernel trick, which makes it difficult to achieve real-time detection. To address this issue, we introduce Random Fourier Features (RFF), which we can handle directly like standard vectors, bypassing the kernel trick. This approach reduces execution time by around 99%, while retaining a high recognition rate. We conduct extensive experiments on several public malware datasets, and demonstrate superior results against several baselines and previous approaches.

The analysis is conducted using three primary malware datasets, BIG2015, Malimg and the Dumpware datasets. 
In addition, we collect a safe class comprising 2500 cleanly coded files from three distinct operating systems: Windows 10 Pro, 11 Home, and 11 Pro. 

All datasets are preprocessed for compatibility with the KCSM and RFF_CSM framework.
